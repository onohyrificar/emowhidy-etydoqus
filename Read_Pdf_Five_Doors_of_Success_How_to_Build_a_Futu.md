Overview
Can you be successful without luck, money, or friends in high places?
 
 Like so many of us, Joshua Candamo wasn&#039;t sure of the answer when he first arrived in the United States without a college degree, struggling to find a minimum-wage job. Today, he shares his answer as a technology executive with a Ph.D. degree and a fulfilling personal life.
 
 The Five Doors of Success systematically deconstructs success into five critical areas that anyone can learn and excel in. These areas aren&#039;t related to attributes you&#039;re born with or reserved for privileged or lucky individuals. They consist of skills and knowledge you build over time. It&#039;s an alternative view compared to what&#039;s widely promoted in public media and presents a word of caution to the &quot;appearance of success&quot; along with the biological and psychological realities that could prevent you from reaching your full potential.
 
 Candamo draws on his experiences and heartfelt stories with impactful people in his lifeâ€”from friends, to presidents, to a former drug cartel memberâ€”all of whom inspired his own journey navigating corporate America. But this book isn&#039;t about replicating his story, per se. That&#039;s entirely the wrong approach because everyone wants something different in life. This book is about demystifying success and providing a path to follow so that you can achieve what matters to youâ€”your own version of success.
