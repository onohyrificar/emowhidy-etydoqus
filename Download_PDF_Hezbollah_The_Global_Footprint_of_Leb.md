Overview
This book remains the most thorough examination of Hezbollah&#039;s covert activities outside Lebanonâ€”with a new preface and epilogue that examine recent developments Hezbollahâ€”which translates as &quot;Party of God&quot;â€”is a multifaceted organization: It is a powerful political party in Lebanon, a Shia Islam religious and social movement, Lebanon&#039;s largest militia, a close ally of Iran and Hamas, and a terrorist organization. Drawing on a wide range of sourcesâ€”including declassified government documents, court records, and personal interviews with intelligence and law enforcement officials around the worldâ€”Hezbollah examines the party&#039;s beginnings, its first violent forays into Lebanon, and its subsequent terrorist activities and criminal enterprises worldwide. The book describes Hezbollah&#039;s ongoing role in Iran&#039;s shadow war with Israel and the West. This updated edition includes a new preface and a substantive epilogue by the author to update readers on Hezbollah&#039;s activities in recent years, particularly in supporting the Assad regime in Syria&#039;s civil war and the latest cross-border fighting between Hezbollah and Israel since October 7, 2023. Levitt shows that Hezbollah&#039;s willingness to use violence both at home and abroad, its global reach, and its proxyâ€“patron relationship with Iran remain serious international concerns. This is an important book for scholars, policymakers, students, and the members of the general public who are interested in international security, terrorism, international criminal organizations, and Middle East studies.
