What initially appears to be yet another disappointing trip to the store with mother, suddenly transforms into a child&amp;#039;s wildest dreams. A giant, magic, pickle-genie surprises a young boy, offering to grant him three wishes. There is a caveat though; the child must work to earn the money for what he wishes. Once earned, he can spend it on whatever he wants to buy. With no one to tell him &amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; the child embarks on a spending adventure. Through his own failed experiences, the child and reader together learn why it matters which kind of things we spend our money on, as well as the benefits of buying investments. Along the journey are mischievous monsters, a time machine, trees that grow money and unexpected surprises. This playful book captivates young minds, while presenting them with the path to their own financial freedom.
