Notes From Your Bookseller A novel of mind-bending visceral and freaky storytelling. Yes, the cover matches the content, and you will love every page. Youâ€™ll be surprised that through the horror and gore is a lot of heart. The light always shines in. Bestselling authors Cassandra Khaw and Richard Kadrey have teamed up to deliver a dark new story with magic, monsters, and mayhem, perfect for fans of unhinged eldritch horror. Julie is a coked-up, burnt-out thirty-year-old whose only retirement plan is dying early. Sheâ€™s been trying to establish herself in the NYC magic scene, and sheâ€™ll work the most gruesome gigs, exorcize the nastiest demons, and make deals with the cruelest gods to claw her way to the top. But nothing can prepare her for the toughest job yet: when her best friend, Sarah, shows up at her door in need of help. Keeping Sarah safe becomes top priority. Julie is desperate for a quick fix to break the dead-end grind and save her friend. But her power grab sets off a deadly chain of events that puts Sarah â€“ and the entire world - directly in the path of annihilation. The first explosive adventure in the Carrion City Duology, The Dead Take the A Train fuses Cassandra Khawâ€™s cosmic horror and Richard Kadreyâ€™s gritty fantasy into a full-throttle thrill ride straight into New Yorkâ€™s magical underbelly.
