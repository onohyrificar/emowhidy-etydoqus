Listen within. You are the expert in you.

 Chronic vertigo, dizziness, and tinnitus are invisible disruptions to a personâ€™s life that can be unresponsive to traditional treatments, leaving sufferers feeling hopeless. Yet healing is possible using neuroplasticity, the brain and bodyâ€™s capacity to change itself. So, why is nobody teaching us how to do it?

 Vestibular audiologist and neuroplasticity therapist Joey Remenyi explains why holistic neuroplasticity is often overlooked; why nobody else can prescribe it for you; and why ignoring, denying, distracting, and avoiding symptoms may not work. Joey gives hope to the hopeless with her pioneering self-study approach to healing chronic symptoms that outlines how we can rebuild a new normal with methodical steps. Using client case studies and her own personal experience, Joey guides the reader to gently feel their way through healingâ€”physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.

 Including home exercise ideas and a heart-centered approach to the science, Rock Steady is the handbook for anyone with chronic unwanted sensations or sounds in their body.
